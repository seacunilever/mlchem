================================
Welcome to mlchem documentation!
================================


**mlchem** is a Python cheminformatics library designed for the scientific community. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for data handling, molecule manipulation, drawing, machine learning, and plotting.
The library has been tested for python  3.11, 3.12 and 3.13. GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/seacunilever/mlchem

============
Installation
============

To install **mlchem**, open your command prompt and use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/seacunilever/mlchem.git

Alternatively, latest release from PiPy (not available yet):

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install mlchem

Development installation, to modify the code or contribute with some changes:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/seacunilever/mlchem
   cd mlchem

   # (Optional: create a virtual environment)
   python3 -m venv _venv
   . ./_venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows:
   .\_venv\Scripts\activate

   # Make an editable install of mlchem from the source tree
   pip install -e .

   # and install requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Features
========

- **Data Handling**: Efficiently manage and process chemical data, including loading, cleaning, and transforming datasets.
- **Molecule Manipulation**: Tools for manipulating molecular structures, such as adding or removing atoms, modifying bonds, and generating molecular conformations.
- **Pattern Recognition**: An extensive list of functions to search for specific structural patterns.
- **Molecule Drawing**: Visualise molecules with customisable drawing options, creating high-quality images for presentations and publications.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning models for cheminformatics, including training, evaluating, and deploying models to predict chemical properties and activities.
- **Feature Analysis and Interpretation**: Interpret model features and provide insightful plots.



Here's a basic example of how to use **mlchem** (this calculates rdkit descriptors for two molecules)::


   from mlchem.chem.manipulation import create_molecule
   from mlchem.chem.calculator import descriptors
   mol1 = create_molecule('c1ccccc1CCCO')
   mol2 = create_molecule('CCCCCN')
   desc_df = descriptors.get_rdkitDesc([mol1, mol2],include_3D=True)
