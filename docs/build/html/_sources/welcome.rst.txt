================================
Welcome to mlchem documentation!
================================


**mlchem** is a Python cheminformatics library designed for the scientific community. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for data handling, molecule manipulation, drawing, machine learning, and plotting.
The library has been tested for python  3.11 and 3.12. 

=========
Features
=========

- **Data Handling**: Efficiently manage and process chemical data, including loading, cleaning, and transforming datasets.
- **Molecule Manipulation**: Tools for manipulating molecular structures, such as adding or removing atoms, modifying bonds, and generating molecular conformations.
- **Pattern Recognition**: An extensive list of functions to search for specific structural patterns.
- **Molecule Drawing**: Visualise molecules with customisable drawing options, creating high-quality images for presentations and publications.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning models for cheminformatics, including training, evaluating, and deploying models to predict chemical properties and activities.
- **Feature Analysis and Interpretation**: Interpret model features and provide insightful plots.



Here's a basic example of how to use **mlchem** (this calculates rdkit descriptors for two molecules)::


   from mlchem.chem.manipulation import create_molecule
   from mlchem.chem.calculator import descriptors
   mol1 = create_molecule('c1ccccc1CCCO')
   mol2 = create_molecule('CCCCCN')
   desc_df = descriptors.get_rdkitDesc([mol1, mol2],include_3D=True)
